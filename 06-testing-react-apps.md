# Testing React Components (work-in-progress)
An important benefit of decoupling from the actual DOM implementation and working at a higher level of abstraction in JavaScript is that we can easily test React components. If you think about it, a component is not radically different than an object or a function, gets some inputs, performs some actions and returns a value (JSX in this case). 

## Jest
Is a testing framework that its easy to setup and use.
Jest has included:
* assertions
* mocks
* spies
* stubs
